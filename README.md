## by (Hillary Kipngeno)


## Dataset


This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.


## Summary of Findings

During the analysis, i came up various findings about the variables and how they relate to the loanoriginalamount. I visualized the distribution of loanoriginalamount and the distribution had many moadal points and various steep spikes across the distribution. prosperscore has a normal distribution starting  from prosper score of 1 having the least frequency and the highest frequency  point being between prosper score of 4 to 8 and drops again upto the prosper score of 10. In the distribution of employment status, employed had the highest frequency and retired the least.Debt income ratio debicts a normal distribution  upto the right last end of the tail where there are some few spikes.Borrowers Rate distribution is a normal distribution and skewed to the right. Is borrowerhomeowner variable has both false and true at almost the same frequency.term distributions has 36 months with the highest distribution followed by 60 and the least frequency being that of 12 months.The relationship between prosperscore and loanoriginal amount is directly proportional.There is an indirect proportion between borrowers rate and loanoriginalamount.The debttoincomeratio has zero correlation with loanoriginalamount.

## Key Insights for Presentation
I would like to focus on the relatioship between prosperscore and loanoriginalamount, Borrowerrate and loanoriginalamoun and the distribution of term. This findings have shown that the prosperscore affects the loanoriginalamount. Whenever a borrower has a high prospectscore they are likely to get a higher loan amount. On the borrower rate, whenever there is a high borrower rate there is likely to be low loanoriginalamount.
In the term distribution, it occurs that many borrowers prefer to take a loan that is of a term of 36 months as compared to both a term of 60 and a term of 12months which is the least likely.
